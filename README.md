## What is Rsync and SSH?

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. The best known example application is for remote login to computer systems by users.

Rsync is a utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files across computer systems, by checking the timestamp and size of files. It is commonly found on Unix-like systems and functions as both a file synchronization and file transfer program. The rsync algorithm is a type of
delta encoding, and is used for minimizing network usage. Zlib may be used for additional compression, and SSH or stunnel can be used for data security.




## How to use this image

Just prepend `rsync`/`ssh` command with `docker run instrumentisto/rsync-ssh`:
```bash
docker run --rm -i instrumentisto/rsync-ssh rsync --help
```

Transferring data from volume to local folder:
```bash
docker run --rm -i -v <volume-name>:/volume -v $(pwd):/mnt instrumentisto/rsync-ssh \
    rsync -avz /volume/ /mnt/
```

Transferring file from remote host with `rsync` to local host without `rsync`:
```bash 
docker run --rm -i -v <local-dest-path>:/mnt instrumentisto/rsync-ssh \
    rsync -avz <remote host>:<remote soruce path> /mnt/
```

Transferring file from remote host without `rsync` to local host with `rsync`:
```bash
rsync -avz --rsync-path="docker run --rm -i -v <remote-src-path>:/mnt instrumentisto/rsync-ssh rsync" \
    <remote host>:/mnt/ <local-dest-path>
```

Transfer file from remote host without `rsync` to local host without `rsync`:
```bash
docker run --rm -i -v <local-dest-path>:/mnt instrumentisto/rsync-ssh \
    rsync -avz --rsync-path="docker run --rm -i -v <remote-src-path>:/mnt instrumentisto/rsync-ssh rsync" \
        <remote-host>:/mnt/ /mnt/
```
